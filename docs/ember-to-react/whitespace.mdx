# Whitespace 

In Ember's Handlebars templates, there's automatic whitespace added between tags by default. However, if you use the `~` in Handlebars, that will override and take up any whitespace ([doc](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#whitespace-control)). For better and for worse, React has no implied whitespace like this. So migrating the `~` will be easier. 

## Ember

```hbs showLineNumbers
<span>
	<b>Really important:</b>
	Use the cheat sheet
</span>
```

## React 

```jsx live noInline
const ImportantNews = () => (
	<span>
		<b>Really important:</b>{' '}
		Use the cheat sheet
	</span>
)

render(<ImportantNews  />)
```

## Further note

- HTML enties can also be used here `&nbsp;` (non-breaking space). However, if you use that syntax, try to stay consistent in the same file for using other entities for whitespace. https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-unescaped-entities.md

- Using CSS to space elements can be a more scalable way of spacing but this is how you to do a 1:1 Ember to React migration
