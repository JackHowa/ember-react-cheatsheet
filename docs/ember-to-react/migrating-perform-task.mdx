# ember-concurrency perform tasks

[ember-concurrency](https://ember-concurrency.com/) is a popular Ember addon for managing asynchronous tasks using generator functions ("tasks") that can be performed, canceled, and tracked for state. In Ember, the `perform` helper is used in templates to invoke these tasks, making it simple to handle async actions like data fetching or user events with robust state management (e.g., isRunning, lastSuccessful).

When migrating from Ember to React, there is no direct equivalent we've created for ember-concurrency tasks or the `perform` helper. Instead, async logic is typically handled via JavaScript async functions, React hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`), or libraries such as [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/). The migration involves:

- Moving generator-based tasks to async functions or Promises.
- Replacing the `perform` helper with explicit function calls (often as event handlers in JSX).

## Ember

In Ember, asynchronous actions are managed using [ember-concurrency](https://ember-concurrency.com/) tasks. Tasks are generator functions decorated with `@task`, which provide built-in state (such as isRunning) and cancellation. The `perform` helper in templates allows you to trigger these tasks directly from user interactions, such as button clicks, while automatically handling task state and preventing race conditions.

```js title="app/components/ice-cream/component.js" showLineNumbers
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import classic from 'ember-classic-decorator';

@classic
export default class IceCreamComponent extends Component {
  @service store;

  @task
  selectFlavor = function* (flavor) {
    const ice = yield this.store.createRecord('ice-cream-flavoflav', {
      flavorSlug: flavor.flavoflavSlug,
    });
    return ice;
  }
}
```

```hbs title="app/components/ice-cream/template.hbs" showLineNumbers
<button
  onclick={{fn (perform this.selectFlavor) "minty chocolate chip"}}
>
  We Want MINT
</button>
```

## React

In React, asynchronous logic is typically handled using async functions, React hooks, or external libraries such as [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/). You manually manage loading and error state. Then, you invoke async actions via event handlers (e.g., `onClick`). This allows flexibility but also requires more explicit state management than in Ember.

By extracting the template logic, you can maintain the same functionality with backend logic in Ember. In this example, we are using a React component inside of an Ember component for the on-click functionality by passing an action.

```js title="app/components/ice-cream/component.js" showLineNumbers
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';
import { action } from '@ember/object';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import classic from 'ember-classic-decorator';

@classic
export default class IceCreamComponent extends Component {
  @service store;

  @task
  selectFlavor = function* (flavor) {
    const ice = yield this.store.createRecord('ice-cream-flavoflav', {
      flavorSlug: flavor.flavoflavSlug,
    });
    return ice;
  }

  @action
  performTaskSelectFlavor(flavor) {
    return this.selectFlavor.perform(flavor);
  }
}
```

```hbs title="app/components/ice-cream/template.hbs" showLineNumbers
<ReactIceCreamButton 
  @performTaskSelectFlavor={{this.performTaskSelectFlavor}}
/>
```

```jsx title="app/components/react-ice-cream-button/index.jsx" showLineNumbers
export default function ReactIceCreamButton({
  performTaskSelectFlavor
}) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => performTaskSelectFlavor("minty chocolate chip")}>
      We Want MINT
    </button>
  )
};
```
