# Ember to React docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Do not commit jfrog lockfiles as the build in netlify is not ready for that authentication. 

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deploy 

Deployed to Netlify.
